# ESG_Finance_Putian

Financial performance has been reported to be strongly associated with Environmental, Social,
and Governance (ESG). Despite a recent surge of attention drawn on relevant topics, it remains
elusive what is the underlying mechanism affecting corporate finance, given that a limited number
of ESG indicators potentially hinders previous findings. Also, extant literature mainly focuses on
large-scale western companies, and recent research on specific regional-level companies also
produces contradictory results. Against this backdrop, this study utilized the Fujian subsample of
non-state-owned corporations’ sustainability self-evaluated surveys from 2020 to 2021 to examine
the effect of ESG on financial performances. This study incorporates a unique approach to
classifying the company's ESG engagement. Building on the methodology developed by the
relevant research, I further employed random forests and different clustering algorithms to
generate ESG typology. Second, I utilized the mediation model to examine the mechanism
between ESG typology and companies’ financial performance. The result generates six
heterogeneous ESG engagement types: ESG limited, stringent governance, human capital
investor, philanthropic leader, stringent governance, product-oriented, and ESG champion. Also,
the mediation analysis strongly supports the mediation mechanism between the company typology
and financial performance via environmental, social, and governance indicators. This study has
important implications for future policy intervention among small-medium size enterprises that
stimulate corporate social responsibility.
